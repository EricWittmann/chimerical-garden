title: Creating my awesome Windows 10 dev setup

## Background

I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love.

There were a few things I wanted to get sorted properly which I hadn't done before:

- A WSL distro which I could work in full-time
- A beautiful terminal setup
- A VSCode setup that worked in WSL

## WSL

Since WSL 2 had just came out with the promise of better performance, I knew I needed to make it my
primary dev environment, so I started by setting it up. You can install it in a few easy steps
following the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). I chose
to run the latest Ubuntu since that's the distro I have had the most experience with in the past.
