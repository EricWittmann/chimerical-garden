## Background

I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:

- Make WSL my primary dev environment
- Use VSCode as my primary editor
- Have a beautiful terminal

## Implementation

### WSL & VSCode

To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find excellent instructions on installing WSL
and/or upgrading it to WSL 2 in the [official
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Next I installed [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [Remote Development extension
pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.

#### Windows Terminal

To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed [Windows
Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/) (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.

Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest [PowerShell
7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/).

Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using CMD or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the `"hidden": true` property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <Shortcut>Ctrl+,</Shortcut>).

##### PowerShell WT Profile

Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:

```json
{
  "guid": "{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}",
  "name": "PowerShell",
  "commandline": "pwsh.exe",
  "icon": "%SystemRoot%\\Installer\\{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}\\PowerShellExe.ico"
}
```

A few things to note:

- To generate a GUID, you can use the [Online GUID
  Generator](https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx) website
- Note that I am using the `pwsh.exe` command instead of `powershell.exe` to use PowerShell 7
- Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:
  1. Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7
  2. Right click on the app and click "Open file location"
  3. In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"
  4. On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path

##### Ubuntu WT Profile

Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level `defaultProfile`
property with the WSL profile's `guid` property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.

Now I want my dev work to take place in a top-level directory to make it easy to reference and
navigate to within a terminal, and I want the terminal to automatically open to that directory. For
my Windows system I chose to make this `D:\code`, and for WSL I chose `~/code`.

To make the terminals automatically open to the correct directory, I added the `"startingDirectory": "D:\\code"`
property to the PowerShell 7 profile, and the `"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"` where
you should replace `Ubuntu` with the name of your WSL distro and `blake` with your WSL username.

Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the [Night
Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme. So, I created a
[VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme)
to automatically generate a WT theme. You can read more about it in [this
post](./generate-windows-terminal-scheme).

#### Shell Profiles

Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.

##### PowerShell Profile

Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run `echo $PROFILE` to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
`C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a [variety of
places](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/) and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work.

To start with I don't want to have to keep remembering where my profile is to edit it, and I also
want to be able to quickly edit it inside the terminal to reduce context switching. Some people
might prefer to use VSCode or some other GUI editor and that's fine too. I added the following to my
script:

```ps1
# C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Set-Alias -Name editor -Value nano
Set-Alias -Name edit -Value editor

function profile_alias { editor $PROFILE }
Set-Alias -Name profile -Value profile_alias

function reload_alias { & $PROFILE }
Set-Alias -Name reload -Value reload_alias
```

Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (`editor` and `edit`) for
my in-terminal editor. If you wanted to use VSCode you could replace `nano` with `code`. My reason
for doing this instead of directly typing using `nano` is so that I can change the editor at any
time and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.

Next, I add the `profile` alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the `editor` alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run `profile` and can start editing it right away. I also add a `reload`
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.

##### Bash Profile

Now for WSL, where we do something very similar. In bash, the profile is located at `~/.bashrc` and
is written in bash. By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to
the bottom of the script. Here's what I added:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

EDITOR="nano"
alias editor="$EDITOR"
alias edit="editor"

PROFILE="~/.bashrc"
alias profile="editor $PROFILE"
alias reload="source $PROFILE"

alias explorer="explorer.exe"
```

This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an `EDITOR` environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the `EDITOR` variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use `EDITOR` to create our `editor` and
`edit` aliases just like before.

Then, I add the same `profile` and `reload` aliases to edit and reload the profile script.

Finally, I added another alias which maps `explorer` to `explorer.exe` which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.

#### Terminal Editor

Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.

So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/), which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!

##### PowerShell Editor

Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's easiest installed via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this post. With scoop installed, simply run `scoop install micro`. Now you can
run `micro` to edit your files.

Let's update our profile script to use it:

```ps1
# C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Set-Alias -Name editor -Value micro
```

TODO: Git?

##### Ubuntu Editor

To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:

```bash
curl https://getmic.ro | bash
```

Now we can update our bash profile to use it:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

EDITOR="micro"
```

TODO: Git?

##### Micro Theme

One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in `simple` theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.

To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <Shortcut>Ctrl+E</Shortcut> to open the command prompt, then enter the command `set colorscheme simple`.

#### Terminal Prompt

Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but I wasn't a big fan of some of the more popular options like
[ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) because they tend to slow down my terminal, which
seriously degrades the dev experience. ohmyzsh also isn't cross-platform. To set something similar
up for PowerShell, you can use [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) which in
my experience is very slow, and is also a distinct option so parity with ohmyzsh requires separate
configuration.

Enter [Starship](https://starship.rs), a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.

##### PowerShell Starship

To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: `scoop install starship`. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):

```ps1
# C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
```

Now we can run our `reload` alias and see the beautiful prompt right away.

##### Bash Starship

Installing Starship for Bash is just as easy. We can run the bash install script from their website:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash
```

To get it running, we can edit our profile:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

eval "$(starship init bash)"
```

Enter `reload` and we can see it in bash now too.

##### Starship Configuration

To configure Starship the same on PowerShell and WSL, we'll start by creating the configuration file
in the Windows filesystem for PowerShell, then create a symlink in the WSL filesystem. You could
also do it the other way around, but I think this is better for a couple reasons:

1. It's easier to create symlinks in Linux than in Windows
2. You could add or remove your WSL distros in the future, so having the configuration in Windows
   means it can be used by multiple WSL distros at once, and it won't be deleted if you remove a WSL
   distro in the future

Starship looks for its configuration file in `~/.config/starship.toml` by default. In PowerShell,
`~` resolves to `C:\Users\<username>`, so we can run the following commands to create our
configuration file:

```ps1
mkdir ~/.config  # It's possible this already exists, especially if you've installed micro
touch ~/.config/starship.toml
```

Now you can add whatever configuration you'd like here. I personally don't like all the extra
newlines they have on by default, and I also don't like a couple of the modules they enable by
default, so this is what my configuration looks like:

```toml
add_newline = false

[line_break]
disabled = true

[package]
disabled = true

[nodejs]
disabled = true
```

I'd encourage you to try out the default settings first to see how _you_ like them before making
these changes though.

Finally, we need to sync these changes to WSL. In bash, you can run these commands to create the
symlink:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config  # It's possible this already exists, especially if you've installed micro
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<username>/.config/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
```

### Conclusion

It's getting easier and easier to create an amazingly beautiful and functional dev environment in
Windows 10 these days. I hope this guide was useful to you and that you learned a few new things
along the way (I know I sure did).

Happy coding!
